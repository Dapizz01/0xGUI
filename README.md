## What is it

A web app based on Svelte to transfer files over the Internet, with the option for end-to-end encryption.

## How it works

It's basically a web-app wrapper for [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) (or any other instance of it), an open source pastebin.

### End-to-end encryption

The files can be encrypted with a mechanism of hybrid encryption, operating exclusively on the browser. The public keys are shared on the pastebin itself.

## Terms of service

The same listed at [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/).
